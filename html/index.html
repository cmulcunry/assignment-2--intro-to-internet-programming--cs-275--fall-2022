    <h2>Making Sprouted California Rice</h2>

    For slightly al dente rice:
    Combine 1 1/4 cups of rice with 2 cups of water or broth and 1 Tbsp olive oil. Bring to a boil and stir once to mix. Reduce heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook for 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.

    For softer rice:
    Increase liquid by 1/2 cup and cook time by 5 minutes.

    <h3>Making White Rice</h3>
    Combine 1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water and 1 Tbsp olive oil. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to the lowest setting. Cook for about 18 minutes.
