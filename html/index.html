            For slightly al dente rice:
            Combine 1 1/4 cups of rice with 2 cups of water or broth and 1 Tbsp olive oil. 
            Bring to a boil and stir once to mix. Reduce heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook for 25 minutes. 
            Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.

            For softer rice:
            Increase liquid by 1/2 cup and cook time by 5 minutes.
